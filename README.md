# Tableau_CitiBike
Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City.
In this Project we will use Tablaeu and Visualize their growth story from their inception in 1913 till date.
We will be using Pandas to clean up the data and aggreagte and then use Tableau to visualize.

Here we will aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard and answer the following questions 
  * By what percentage has total ridership grown?
  * How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
  * What are the peak hours in which bikes are used.
  * Today, what are the top 10 busiest stations in the city?
  * Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
  *  How does the average trip duration change by age?
  * Also a route map from a given origin
